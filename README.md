## Interesting data structures and algorithms for me to play around with 

Currently, there is only an AVL Tree in here

I hope to add:
- Skip lists
- Treaps
- Random binary search trees
- Quad Trees
- Range Trees
- Fenwick Trees
- Segment Trees
- Interval Trees
- Splay Trees
- Red Black Trees
- B-Trees and B+ Trees
- R-Trees and R+ Trees
- LSMs
- KMP
- Boyer Moore string matching
- Network flows
- Aho Corasick Algorithm
- Suffix Array
- Suffix Tree
- Suffix Automaton
